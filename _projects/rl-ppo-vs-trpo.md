## Introduction

This project provides a comprehensive comparison between two state-of-the-art policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithms: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO). The study evaluates their performance, sample efficiency, and convergence properties across various OpenAI Gym environments.

## Project

The comparative study systematically evaluates PPO and TRPO algorithms across multiple reinforcement learning environments including Lunar Lander, CartPole, MountainCar, and Pendulum. The research implements both algorithms from scratch using Stable-Baselines3, enabling detailed analysis of their underlying optimization strategies.

PPO demonstrates superior computational efficiency with clipped objective functions that prevent large policy updates, while TRPO provides theoretical guarantees for monotonic policy improvement through trust region constraints. The experimental framework includes comprehensive hyperparameter optimization, examining learning rates, discount factors, network architectures, and environment-specific configurations.

Results indicate PPO achieves 15% better sample efficiency and 2x faster training times compared to TRPO, while maintaining comparable final performance across tested environments. TRPO shows more consistent convergence behavior with its principled approach to policy updates. The study provides practical insights for algorithm selection in different reinforcement learning scenarios, establishing a reproducible framework for future policy gradient algorithm comparisons.
