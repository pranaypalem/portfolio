## Technical Implementation

### Artificial Potential Field Framework

#### Core Concepts
- **Attractive Potential**: Guides robots toward target destinations
- **Repulsive Potential**: Creates avoidance forces from obstacles
- **Inter-robot Potential**: Manages robot-to-robot interactions
- **Formation Potential**: Maintains desired geometric arrangements

#### Mathematical Foundation
```python
def compute_attractive_force(position, goal):
    """
    Compute attractive force toward goal position
    """
    distance = np.linalg.norm(goal - position)
    direction = (goal - position) / distance
    
    # Parabolic potential for close distances, conic for far
    if distance <= d_goal:
        force = -k_att * (goal - position)
    else:
        force = -k_att * d_goal * direction
    
    return force

def compute_repulsive_force(position, obstacles):
    """
    Compute repulsive forces from obstacles
    """
    total_force = np.zeros(2)
    
    for obstacle in obstacles:
        distance = np.linalg.norm(position - obstacle)
        
        if distance <= rho_0:  # Influence radius
            direction = (position - obstacle) / distance
            magnitude = k_rep * (1/distance - 1/rho_0) * (1/distance**2)
            force = magnitude * direction
            total_force += force
    
    return total_force
```

### Multi-Robot Coordination

#### Formation Control
- **Virtual Structure**: Rigid formation maintenance
- **Leader-Follower**: Hierarchical coordination
- **Distributed Control**: Decentralized decision making
- **Adaptive Formation**: Dynamic shape adjustment

#### Collision Avoidance
```python
class MultiRobotPlanner:
    def __init__(self, num_robots, safety_radius=0.5):
        self.num_robots = num_robots
        self.safety_radius = safety_radius
        self.positions = np.zeros((num_robots, 2))
        self.velocities = np.zeros((num_robots, 2))
    
    def compute_inter_robot_forces(self, robot_id):
        """
        Compute forces from other robots for collision avoidance
        """
        position = self.positions[robot_id]
        total_force = np.zeros(2)
        
        for other_id in range(self.num_robots):
            if other_id != robot_id:
                other_position = self.positions[other_id]
                distance = np.linalg.norm(position - other_position)
                
                if distance <= self.safety_radius * 2:
                    direction = (position - other_position) / distance
                    magnitude = k_robot * (1/distance - 1/(2*self.safety_radius))
                    force = magnitude * direction
                    total_force += force
        
        return total_force
    
    def update_robot_position(self, robot_id, goal, obstacles, dt):
        """
        Update robot position based on potential field forces
        """
        position = self.positions[robot_id]
        
        # Compute forces
        f_attractive = self.compute_attractive_force(position, goal)
        f_repulsive = self.compute_repulsive_force(position, obstacles)
        f_robots = self.compute_inter_robot_forces(robot_id)
        
        # Total force
        total_force = f_attractive + f_repulsive + f_robots
        
        # Update velocity and position
        self.velocities[robot_id] += total_force * dt
        self.positions[robot_id] += self.velocities[robot_id] * dt
```
