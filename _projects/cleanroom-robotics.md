### Motion Planning Pipeline
```python
# Quaternion-based inverse kinematics for SCARA
def scara_inverse_kinematics(target_pose, robot_params):
    """

    for improved 3D orientation control in constrained spaces
    """
    x, y, z = target_pose[:3]
    target_quaternion = target_pose[3:7]
    
    # Joint angle calculations
    l1, l2 = robot_params['link_lengths']
    
    # Shoulder and elbow angle computation
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    
    if abs(cos_theta2) > 1:
        raise ValueError("Target position unreachable")
    
    theta2 = np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x) - np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta2))
    
    # Quaternion-based wrist orientation
    wrist_orientation = compute_wrist_angles(target_quaternion, theta1, theta2)
