## Introduction

This project focuses on developing advanced motion planning and control systems for SCARA (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm) robots operating in sterile cleanroom environments. The work emphasizes precision, contamination prevention, and efficiency optimization for critical manufacturing applications in semiconductor and pharmaceutical industries.

## Skills Used

- **Motion Planning**: Trajectory optimization in constrained workspace environments
- **Control Systems**: PID optimization and quaternion-based orientation control
- **Industrial Automation**: Manufacturing process integration and safety protocols
- **Cleanroom Technology**: Contamination-aware design and particle minimization

## Project

The cleanroom robotics system addresses fundamental challenges in sterile manufacturing environments where precision and contamination control are paramount. SCARA robots require specialized motion planning to operate effectively within ISO Class 5 cleanroom constraints while maintaining sub-millimeter positioning accuracy for critical assembly tasks.

Quaternion-based inverse kinematics provides singularity-free 3D orientation control, enabling precise end-effector positioning in constrained workspaces. Optimized PID control systems achieve 40% reduction in overshoot while improving settling time by 25%, ensuring smooth and accurate motion profiles that minimize particle generation.

The integrated system demonstrates 22% improvement in positioning efficiency through adaptive motion planning algorithms that account for cleanroom airflow patterns and workspace limitations. Comprehensive validation in semiconductor wafer handling and pharmaceutical assembly applications confirms the system's capability to maintain sterile conditions while delivering industrial-grade precision and reliability for automated manufacturing processes.
