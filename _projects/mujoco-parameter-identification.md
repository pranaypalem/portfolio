## Project

The parameter identification system addresses critical challenges in computational physics by creating an automated framework for estimating material properties from observed behavior. The system combines experimental data collection through Tracker video analysis with sophisticated MuJoCo physics simulations to determine unknown parameters.

SciPy optimization algorithms minimize mean square error between experimental observations and simulated predictions, enabling accurate identification of material properties including stiffness coefficients and damping parameters. The framework implements robust numerical methods to handle parameter sensitivity and avoid local minima during optimization.

The automated pipeline includes comprehensive validation testing and GitHub Actions CI/CD integration, ensuring reproducible results across different computational environments. This approach significantly reduces manual parameter tuning efforts while improving simulation accuracy for complex physical systems, establishing a foundation for automated calibration of physics-based models in robotics and material science applications.
