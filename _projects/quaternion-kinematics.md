## Project

The quaternion-based kinematics framework provides singularity-free representation for 3D rotations, offering significant advantages over traditional Euler angle methods. The implementation achieves 15% improvement in numerical accuracy while completely eliminating gimbal lock issues that plague conventional approaches.

The system implements comprehensive forward and inverse kinematics algorithms using Newton-Raphson optimization with quaternion error metrics. Analytical Jacobian derivation enables real-time velocity control applications while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for 1kHz control rates.

Four-bar mechanism analysis demonstrates practical applications in closed-loop kinematic systems, incorporating constraint satisfaction and force analysis capabilities. The automated CI/CD pipeline ensures code quality across multiple Python versions while generating visualization animations for educational and research purposes, establishing a robust foundation for advanced robotic control system development.
