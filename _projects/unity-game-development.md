## Introduction

This project represents my journey into game development using Unity Engine, following the comprehensive "Create with Code" course curriculum. I developed a 3D vehicle driving simulation that demonstrates core game development concepts including physics, user interaction, and 3D graphics programming.

## Skills Used

- **Game Engine Development**: Unity Engine for 3D game creation
- **C# Programming**: Object-oriented programming for game logic and mechanics
- **3D Graphics**: Working with 3D models, textures, and lighting systems
- **Game Physics**: Implementing realistic vehicle movement and collision detection
- **Interactive Design**: Creating engaging user experiences and gameplay mechanics

## Project

Following Unity's Create with Code course structure, I successfully completed Unit 1 and am currently progressing through the remaining modules. The project features a 3D driving simulation where players can control a vehicle in a realistic environment with proper physics and interactive elements.

The development process involved learning fundamental Unity concepts including:
- Scene management and game object hierarchy
- C# scripting for game logic and player controls
- Physics system integration for realistic vehicle movement
- User interface design and implementation
- Asset management and optimization

This hands-on learning approach has provided valuable experience in game development workflows, from initial concept to playable prototype. The project serves as a foundation for more advanced game development concepts and demonstrates practical application of programming principles in an interactive entertainment context.

Currently continuing with the course to expand knowledge in areas such as advanced scripting, multiplayer functionality, and game optimization techniques. The Create with Code curriculum provides an excellent pathway for developing comprehensive game development skills using industry-standard tools and practices.
