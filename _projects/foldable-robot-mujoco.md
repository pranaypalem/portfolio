## Introduction

This project develops a biomimetic robotic system inspired by basilisk lizard locomotion, featuring adaptive movement capabilities through four-bar mechanism design. The system demonstrates dynamic transitions between quadrupedal and bipedal locomotion modes, optimized through comprehensive MuJoCo physics simulation.

## Skills Used

- **Biomimetic Design**: Nature-inspired locomotion mechanisms and adaptive behaviors
- **Physics Simulation**: Advanced MuJoCo modeling with quaternion-based kinematics
- **Control Theory**: Servo dynamics modeling and parameter optimization
- **Optimization**: Iterative parameter testing and performance enhancement
- **Mechanical Design**: Four-bar linkage systems and configurable mechanisms

## Project

The foldable robotics project addresses fundamental challenges in adaptive locomotion by developing a biomimetic system that transitions seamlessly between different movement modes. Inspired by basilisk lizard locomotion patterns, the four-bar mechanism enables dynamic reconfiguration between quadrupedal ground-based movement and bipedal high-speed locomotion.

The simulation framework implements 196+ unique robot configurations with adaptive initialization techniques that improve simulation stability by 60%. Quaternion-based kinematics provide robust rotational representation while servo dynamics modeling reduces the sim-to-real gap for practical deployment.

The system demonstrates exceptional versatility across 2-100 segmented-body configurations, enabling scalable design approaches for various applications. Iterative parameter testing in MuJoCo validates performance across diverse terrains and operational scenarios, establishing a comprehensive foundation for future biomimetic robot development and deployment in dynamic environments.
