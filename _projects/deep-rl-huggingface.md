## Introduction

Successfully completed the Deep Reinforcement Learning Course by Hugging Face, an incredible hands-on journey through the foundations and state-of-the-art techniques of Deep RL. This comprehensive course provided practical experience with key algorithms, popular libraries, and real-world applications in robotics and autonomous systems.

## Skills Used

- **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: Policy optimization and advanced RL algorithms
- **RL Libraries**: Stable Baselines3, CleanRL, and Sample Factory frameworks
- **Environment Training**: VizDoom, PyBullet, and custom simulation environments
- **Model Deployment**: Hugging Face Hub integration and model sharing
- **Practical RL Workflow**: From experimentation to deployment pipelines

## Project

This course was an incredible hands-on journey through the foundations and state-of-the-art of Deep RL. I explored key algorithms, experimented with popular libraries like Stable Baselines3, CleanRL, and Sample Factory, and trained agents in both classic and custom environments from VizDoom to PyBullet and more.

Through weekly theory + practice modules and real-world challenges, I:
✅ Strengthened my understanding of policy optimization techniques
✅ Built and shared agents on the Hugging Face Hub
✅ Sharpened my practical RL workflow—from experimentation to deployment

This experience has greatly enhanced my ability to design and apply RL for robotics applications—an area I'm deeply passionate about. It aligns perfectly with my broader goals as a Robotics Engineer and Reinforcement Learning enthusiast, where I strive to create intelligent, adaptive systems.

The trained models, including PPO agents for various environments, are available on my [Hugging Face Hub profile](https://huggingface.co/PranayPalem), demonstrating practical implementation of deep reinforcement learning algorithms across diverse simulation environments.

A huge thanks to the Hugging Face team for making such an impactful course freely accessible to learners worldwide!
